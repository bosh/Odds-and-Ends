Dwarven Dig (c) 2009 Alex Lobascio

Move with WADS, IJKL
Running into mountainside mines it
Darker backgrounds mean more Hp
'.'s are dirt, freely walkable
The gold is in the most central northern part of the map
To upgrade picks, go to the lower left or lower right corner of the map
You can only use each spot to upgrade once
