Various things I've decided to keep around.

	*(8)Blood Gulch
		A map based on the Halo multiplayer map, Blood Gulch. Currently it supports 4v4 team play with the objective of either reaching a certain kill count or capturing the flag for points.
		Features:
		-Weapons on item-spawn counters using triggers and switches
		-Vehicles on similar switches, though there is not currently support for exiting vehicles or item persistence while using a vehicle
		-Indoor areas representative of the insides of the bases
		-Separate areas for the enclosed caves on the west side of the map
		-Unit upgrades to increase damage and armor with different weapons/classes of unit
	*That's it for now...
